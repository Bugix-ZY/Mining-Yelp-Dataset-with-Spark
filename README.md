## Data Exploration <a name="data-exploration"/>

We performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset, and here are some Interesting Findings:
- TBA
- TBA



## Frequent Itemset Mining <a name="frequent-itemset-mining"/>
### High level design

### Conclusion

 Not surprisingly, we found that the restaurants are **geographically close** to each other or they **serve similar food** (maybe have similar business names) in almost all frequent sets. (*e.g. Ramen Sora, Sushi House Goyemon, Monta Ramen*)



## Similar Businesses <a name="similar-businesses"/>
### High level design

<img alt="similar-items" src="imgs/similar-items.png" width="700"/>

First we use **MinHash** to generate signature of each business, then apply **LSH** to find all candidate pairs, and finally do a full pass to eliminate all false positives. 

### Results
We spent quite some time on designing **hash functions**, and suprisingly, we achieve **precision=1.0** and **recall=1.0** .



## Hybrid Recommender System <a name="hybrid-recommender-system"/>

### High level design

<img alt="hybrid-recommender" src="imgs/hybrid-recommender.png" width="500"/>

Each candidate is rated by 3 recommenders: **content-based filtering, model-based collaborative filtering, and user-based CF**.  A linear combination of the 3 scores computed, which becomes the item's predicted rating.


### Results: 
The ratings range from 1 to 5, and the error distribution on testing data looks like: 

<img alt="Error distribution on testing data" src="imgs/rec-error-dist.png" width="500"/>

About **98%** prediction error are less than 1.0, and the overall **RMSE** is 0.9782, which is much better than any individual recommender system.


## Dependencies <a name="dependencies"/>
* Spark 2.4
* Python 3.6
* JDK 1.8
